<p><em>Voice-powered AI meets a visual companion for entertainment, everyday help, and everything in between. </em>&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Redmond, Wash., August 27</em>—Today, we’re announcing the launch of<em> </em>Copilot on select Samsung TVs and monitors, transforming the biggest screen in your home into your most personal and helpful companion—and it’s free to use. &nbsp;<br><br>Copilot makes your TV easier and more fun to use with its voice-powered interface, friendly on-screen character, and simple visual cards. Now you can quickly find what you’re looking for and discover new favorites right from your living room.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because it lives on the biggest screen in the home, Copilot is a social experience—something you can use together with family and friends to spark conversations, help groups decide what to watch, and turn the TV into a shared space for curiosity and connection.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Copilot on Samsung TVs and monitors brings AI out of your pocket and into the heart of your home,&#8221; said David Washington, Partner General Manager, Microsoft AI. &#8220;It’s there when you and your family want to discover something to watch together, get answers to your questions, plan your weekend, or simply hang out.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="built-on-partnership">Built on partnership&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Microsoft and Samsung have a long history of bringing the best of technology together, from Windows and Office on Galaxy devices to Xbox Cloud Gaming on Samsung TVs. This collaboration brings that same spirit of innovation to Copilot, making your TV smarter, more personal, and more fun.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="for-recaps-rabbit-holes-and-everything-in-between">For recaps, rabbit holes, and everything in-between&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Copilot shines when it comes to finding your next favorite thing to watch, but it’s also there for the little questions, big plans, and everyday moments in between.&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Custom, spoiler-free recaps: </strong>&#8220;I want to get back into <em>The Crown, </em>I left off at Season 3, Episode 4. What happened up until then?&#8221;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Ultra-specific recommendations: </strong>&#8220;Like <em>The Queen’s Gambit</em>, but about cooking instead of chess, and under two hours.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Group-friendly picks</strong>: &#8220;Hannah likes rom-coms, David likes sci-fi, Mark likes thrillers. What’s something we’ll all like?&#8221; Perfect for when everyone’s gathered in the living room and you want to decide together.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Post-watch deep dives: </strong>&#8220;Who was the voice actor for that character?&#8221; or &#8220;What else has the director done?&#8221;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Everyday help:</strong> &#8220;Will Saturday in Seattle be good conditions for hiking?&#8221; or &#8220;Cheer me up after a breakup.&#8221;  </li>
</ul>



<div class="wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile is-vertically-aligned-center" style="grid-template-columns:85% auto"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><video controls src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/MS_Copilot_Samsung-JR-v02.1.mp4"></video></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">
<p></p>
</div></div>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="a-more-visual-more-personal-experience">A more visual, more personal experience </h2>



<p>Copilot’s <strong>appearance</strong> is a friendly, animated presence on your TV that reacts and lip-syncs as it speaks, with expressions that match the tone of the conversation. It’s a visible reminder that your companion is listening, thinking, and responding just for you.&nbsp;<br><br>And when Copilot answers, it doesn’t just tell you; it <strong>shows</strong> you. Movies, weather, and image results appear as rich, glanceable cards designed for the big screen, complete with ratings, photos, and key details.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>How it works</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<ol start="1" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Activate Copilot: </strong>Copilot will roll out automatically on select Samsung TVs. Users can see Copilot (on the Apps Tab) at the Samsung Tizen OS home Samsung Daily+. Press the mic button on your Samsung remote and speak naturally.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>



<ol start="2" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>(Optional) Sign in for a personal touch:</strong> Use a quick QR code to connect your Microsoft account and unlock Copilot’s personalization, memory, and preferences for you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ol>



<ol start="3" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Ask for what you want: </strong>Whether it’s a title, a question, or advice, Copilot understands.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>



<ol start="4" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>See and hear your answer: </strong>Watch Copilot respond with a mix of visuals and voice.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<p>We’re excited to announce that&nbsp;GPT-5 is now available in Microsoft Copilot&nbsp;across all markets and platforms—including web, Windows, Mac, and mobile.<ins></ins></p>



<p>GPT‑5 is the most advanced AI system to date. It’s a unified system built to understand when to respond quickly and when to think more deeply, delivering expert-level results with less effort from you. At its core is a fast, high‑throughput model for everyday questions, a deeper reasoning model (GPT-5 thinking) for complex tasks, and a real‑time router that intelligently selects the right approach based on your intent and the conversation’s complexity.</p>



<p>With the new&nbsp;Smart Mode, Copilot automatically adapts to your task and routes you to the most capable model, removing the need to switch or guess. Whether you&#8217;re solving complex problems, writing creatively, or turning ideas into visuals, Smart Mode delivers the smartest, most intuitive experience yet.</p>

<p>Today Microsoft is incorporating GPT-5,&nbsp;<a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OpenAI’s best AI system to date</a>, into a wide variety of its products, to bring new reasoning capabilities and improvements to coding and chat across its platforms. GPT-5, which was trained on Azure, includes OpenAI’s latest reasoning models, along with a smart, efficient model, to provide users with the right tool for the task at hand, whether in a consumer, enterprise or developer context.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Through Microsoft 365 Copilot and Microsoft Copilot, enterprise and consumer users can automatically get the benefit of powerful new AI reasoning capabilities to take on increasingly complex tasks – and still rely on fast and more creative responses for many everyday use cases – without having to think about which model is best for the job, thanks to a real-time router.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Developers across Microsoft platforms will have access to OpenAI’s GPT-5 as well. For example, developers using GitHub Copilot and Visual Studio Code can write, test and deploy code using OpenAI’s&nbsp;<a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-for-developer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best model yet</a>&nbsp;for coding and agentic tasks, which OpenAI says can complete longer and more complex coding tasks and excels at executing long-running agentic tasks end-to-end. Starting today, developers will also have access to the latest GPT-5 models in Azure AI Foundry, with trusted enterprise-grade security, compliance and privacy protections available in Azure. They will be supported by&nbsp;<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/openai/concepts/model-router" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft’s built-in model router in Azure AI Foundry</a>&nbsp;to ensure the right model is used.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://news.microsoft.com/source/features/ai/red-teams-think-like-hackers-to-help-keep-ai-safe/?msockid=175e172bf3356ceb3927013ef2f26d3a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft AI Red Team</a>, which works to anticipate and reduce potential harms by probing critical AI systems before they are released, tested the GPT-5 reasoning model using its rigorous security protocols. The results show that the reasoning model exhibited one of the strongest AI safety profiles among prior OpenAI models against several modes of attack, including malware generation, fraud/scam automation and other harms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The upgrades will be available starting today, giving Microsoft’s consumer, developer and enterprise users immediate access to the increased intelligence and advanced reasoning of the GPT-5 models. Here’s a more detailed look at how the models will roll out across Microsoft products and platforms:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://news.microsoft.com/source/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/microsoft-365-copilot-gpt-5-1024x576.png" alt="An interface of Microsoft 365 Copilot showcasing GPT-5" class="wp-image-21626" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="microsoft-365-copilot">Microsoft 365 Copilot &nbsp;</h2>



<p>With GPT-5,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/?p=278895" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft 365 Copilot</a>&nbsp;is better at reasoning through complex questions, staying on track in longer conversations and understanding the user’s context.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Copilot also will now be able to tackle more complicated problems. Customers with Microsoft 365 Copilot licenses can also reason over emails, documents and files – allowing enterprise users to apply OpenAI’s most advanced models to stay on top of work responsibilities and be more productive.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>GPT-5 will also be available in Microsoft Copilot Studio, a platform for building custom agents. Users can select GPT-5 in custom prompts to enable agents to take on more complex business processes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://news.microsoft.com/source/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/microsoft-copilot-gpt-5.gif" alt="" class="wp-image-21623" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="microsoft-copilot">Microsoft Copilot&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Microsoft Copilot is the AI companion for everyday tasks, with the ability to assist users in getting answers to tough questions, sharpening their writing or turning ideas into images. Today, people can experience the power of GPT-5 in Copilot for free. The new Smart mode utilizes the latest GPT-5 model to help anyone discover the best possible solutions to their queries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>People can try GPT-5 with Microsoft Copilot for free by going to copilot.microsoft.com, or using the Copilot app on Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="github-copilot-and-visual-studio-code">GitHub Copilot and Visual Studio Code&nbsp;</h2>



<p>GitHub is bringing GPT-5 to all paid&nbsp;<a href="https://github.blog/changelog/2025-08-07-openai-gpt-5-is-now-in-public-preview-for-github-copilot">GitHub Copilot plans</a>. Developers will be able to write, test and deploy code across GitHub Copilot Chat on&nbsp;<a href="http://github.com/">github.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://aka.ms/VSCode/1103/m">Visual Studio Code</a>&nbsp;and GitHub Mobile through the model picker. With the Azure AI Foundry extension, developers in VS Code can also use GPT-5 to develop agents — without leaving the code editor.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="azure-ai-foundry">Azure AI Foundry&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Azure AI Foundry&nbsp;<a href="https://aka.ms/GPT-5-blog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is making all GPT-5 models</a>&nbsp;available for developers. Starting today, developers can use the model router in Azure AI Foundry to maximize the capabilities of the GPT-5 system of models and other models in Azure AI Foundry. With an AI-powered orchestration layer, the model router evaluates each prompt and decides the optimal model based on the complexity, performance needs and cost efficiency of each task.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>For an optimal mobile viewing experience, use landscape mode.</em></p>



<p>We’re excited to announce that Copilot Vision on Windows with Highlights is now available in the US. This is a major step forward in our journey to make Copilot your everyday companion: one that works with you, sees what you see, and helps you get things done. As Copilot becomes more optimized for Windows, it stands apart as your go-to AI companion that’s ready to be there as a sounding board and a guide when you need it.</p>

<p>Copilot Vision on Windows is an all-new way to engage with your Windows PC, assisting you when needed. When you choose to enable it, Copilot Vision can see what you see and talk to you about it in real time.&nbsp; It acts as your second set of eyes, able to analyze content, help when you’re lost, provide insights, and answer your questions as you go. Whether you’re browsing, working, or deep in a project, Copilot Vision offers instant insights and answers, keeping your flow smooth and effortless.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>What brings Copilot Vision on Windows to life is the ability to navigate multiple apps at once, and have Copilot serve as a guide when you want it to. You’re now able to share two apps at a time so Copilot travels with you as you work to gain more context, connecting dots between different apps. And with Highlights, you can go a step further and ask Copilot “show me how” for a specific task and it will show you within the app where to click and what to do. Altogether, Copilot can be by your side giving you tips while playing a game, viewing your photo and showing you how to improve the lighting to make it perfect, or reviewing your travel itinerary to let you know if your packing list is sufficient based on your destination.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>   </p>

<p>Welcome to Microsoft’s Copilot Release Notes. Here we’ll provide regular updates on what’s happening with Copilot, from new features to firmware updates and more.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="try-copilot-actions-now-in-copilot-labs">Try Copilot Actions — Now in Copilot Labs&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Let Copilot lend you a hand with everyday web tasks. Copilot Actions is a new experimental feature available to Copilot Pro users in the U.S., designed to help you get things done — not just find answers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With simple chat prompts, you can ask Copilot to:&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Book a hotel&nbsp;</li>



<li>Make a dinner reservation&nbsp;</li>



<li>Order flowers&nbsp;</li>



<li>Find a flight&nbsp;</li>



<li>Schedule a tour&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>…and much more — all from your browser.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:85% auto"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><video controls src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/anim_02_actions_v011.mp4"></video></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">
<p></p>
</div></div>



<p>Copilot works behind the scenes to complete tasks on your behalf, and you stay in control every step of the way. You can pause, stop, edit, or take over at any time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Available now in Copilot Labs on any modern browser.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Example prompts to try:</em>&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>“Order me a bouquet of flowers using 1800Flowers.com”&nbsp;</li>



<li>“Book me a hotel room on Hotels.com for this weekend”&nbsp;</li>



<li>“Make a dinner reservation for two at an Italian restaurant on OpenTable.com”&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="recipes-and-instacart">Recipes and Instacart &nbsp;</h2>



<p>Getting all your ingredients ready just got even easier on Copilot with Instacart. With Recipe cards, you can now directly purchase ingredients in Copilot. Simply select “Shop Ingredients on Instacart” while using Copilot on iOS, Android, the Mac app, or Copilot.com.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Recipe feature is enabled for all users — no sign-in required — and is available across all Copilot markets, making it effortless to find inspiration and shop for ingredients seamlessly. Currently, the Instacart Buy option is only available in the U.S., but it will be extending to Canada soon!&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="upgraded-4o-image-generation">Upgraded 4o image generation&nbsp;</h2>



<p>We’ve upgraded Copilot’s image generation with 4o image generation, allowing you to create images with even richer detail and composition.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With this update, Copilot also does a much better job of refining images based on a previous image — and now you can even upload your own image to use as a starting point, giving you more creative control and flexibility.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can try the upgraded experience today in the Copilot mobile app on iOS and Android, on Copilot.com, within Copilot in Edge, and on GroupMe.</p>



<p>This experience will be available in the Windows app, Mac app, and other platforms in the coming weeks. Stay tuned!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="quiz-cards-are-now-live">Quiz Cards are now live&nbsp;</h2>



<p>We’re excited to announce that you can now ask Copilot to generate a quiz! Quiz Cards offer an interactive way to challenge your knowledge or to study for that test you’ve got tomorrow.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Creating a quiz is easy: Just<strong> ask Copilot to create a quiz on the topic</strong>—from math, science, or history to pop culture and beyond. An example question could be something like, “Copilot, can you quiz me on limits and derivatives in calculus?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Quizzes are currently only available on <a href="https://copilot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">copilot.com</a> and the Copilot Mobile app.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="set-copilot-as-the-default-digital-assistant-on-your-android-mobile-device">Set Copilot as the default digital assistant on your Android mobile device&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Copilot is now here to support you on your Android device, no matter where you are in the world. Whether you need help sending messages, setting timers, alarms, or even requesting a rideshare, Copilot is ready to assist from the convenience of your Android mobile device.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="new-vision-updates-for-windows-insiders">New Vision updates for Windows Insiders</h2>



<p>A new update to Copilot Vision has been released and allows Copilot Vision to assist with interactive “<strong>show me how</strong>” visual guidance, highlighting exactly where to click within a shared app to help you complete tasks step-by-step. It also adds support for <strong>sharing two apps simultaneously</strong>, enabling Copilot to analyze and provide insights across both.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>These features are currently available to Windows Insiders in the U.S. and are rolling out gradually.

<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="introducing-deep-research">Introducing Deep Research&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Need to tackle a complex research task on your own? Copilot’s Deep Research is here to lend a helping hand. This new feature uses one of the most powerful advanced reasoning models available to find, analyze, and synthesize comprehensive research from the web — delivering well-crafted, in-depth results that can save you hours of work.  </p>



<p>Currently available in English for Pro users, with support for additional languages coming soon.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="new-hispanic-voices-alder-and-elm-now-available">New Hispanic voices: Alder and Elm, now available&nbsp;</h2>



<p>We’ve added two new Hispanic voices — Alder and Elm — to bring even more personality and warmth to your Copilot experience. Whether you&#8217;re listening to summaries, stories, or spoken responses, these new voices make interactions feel more natural and engaging.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>To try them out, just head to your Voice settings in the profile menu and choose your preferred voice. Let us know what you think!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="copilot-is-now-available-on-motorola-devices">Copilot is now available on Motorola devices&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Copilot is now integrated into Motorola’s latest RAZR and Edge devices! As part of our new partnership with Motorola, users can invoke Copilot through Moto AI by typing or saying “Ask Copilot [<em>your question</em>]” to get started. For example, try asking:&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;“<em>Ask Copilot, I have a presentation coming up — what are some ideas to kick it off and keep the audience engaged?”</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Right from Moto AI, Copilot will jump in to help you brainstorm and prepare. This integration is rolling out to millions of devices globally, making it easier than ever to get help from Copilot from the convenience of your mobile device. &nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="upload-larger-files-up-to-50mb">Upload larger files — up to 50MB&nbsp;</h2>



<p>You can now upload files up to 50MB in size — a big jump from the previous 5MB limit. That means larger PowerPoint presentations, PDFs, and Word documents are now supported with ease. If your file is still being processed, Copilot will let you know and continue working in the background. This new size limit will be coming soon to the Copilot mobile app in the next few weeks!&nbsp;</p>
